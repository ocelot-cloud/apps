* Prepare public apps feature
  * auto update + stability test feature, maybe first locally, then on a hetzner server? where to put the code? maybe to the app store as the API code is already there? create cobra command "update official apps"?
  * add package signing?
  * when having automated updates, write that into threat model. Maybe buy a docker hub premium account in order to be able to download many images without rate limiting.
  * make tests checking whether the setup was successful, e.g. health checks on the "main service"?

* automated update via single CLI command
* stability test, maybe add healthchecks? docker and manual ones?
* eye to eye check? human readable summary (everything okay? if not, which app updates are not working?)
* adaptions possible?
* package as zips and upload; maybe have a test account in app store?
* ensure that the current tag is replaced by a higher one than the previous one. E.g. 1.3.2 is higher that 1.2.3, even if the latter was uploaded later.

gitea:
  gitea/gitea: 1.23.8 -> 1.24.3
  postgres: 17.4-alpine -> 17.6-alpine
summary: all services healthy
