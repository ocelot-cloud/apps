* first use case - healthcheck
  * use app.yml to find out at which port the app shall be running
  * inject the port in docker-compose yml and start app
  * check if index page is available
  * I need a minimal sample app for testing

* Prepare public apps feature
  * auto update + stability test feature
  * when having automated updates, write that into threat model. Maybe buy a docker hub premium account in order to be able to download many images without rate limiting.
  * make tests checking whether the setup was successful, e.g. health checks on the "main service"?

* idea: each postgres database should have the same version. This means only a single postgres image is needed, which is then used by all apps
* automated update via single CLI command
* stability test, maybe add healthchecks? docker and manual ones?
* eye to eye check? human readable summary (everything okay? if not, which app updates are not working?)
* adaptions possible?
* package as zips and upload; maybe have a test account in app store?
* ensure that the current tag is replaced by a higher one than the previous one. E.g. 1.3.2 is higher that 1.2.3, even if the latter was uploaded later.
* maybe let updates fail through a "could not be decided" code, when software is not sure whether the new tag is higher than the previous one.
* the api to access the app store should be put in the "shared" module to avoid duplication. It will be used in three components: updater, cloud, store.
* take care of apps/todo folder
  * either make it a production app or remove it
  * app package signing for official apps? then I need to safe two file in the app store: the zip and the signed checksum files
* upload stable apps to the app store in t he end
* add package signing?

gitea:
  gitea/gitea: 1.23.8 -> 1.24.3
  postgres: 17.4-alpine -> 17.6-alpine
summary: all services healthy

* add apps?
  * odoo for ERP
  * limesurvey for feedback
  * "discuit" for memes
  * lemmy as alternative to reddit
  * make a video where I set up and explain all apps that are currently official + specialities in guides
  * consider other apps from the internal list
