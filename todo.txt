TODOS

features:
* add indentation in reports, also newlines for each updates service, dont press it in a single line
* app selection: add argument []string, if empty perform on all apps, otherwise only on specified apps
* updates should be written into the docker-compose.yml file
  * login to store
  * the api to access the app store should be put in the "shared" module to avoid duplication. It will be used in three components: updater, cloud, store
  * when having automated updates, write that into threat model. Maybe buy a docker hub premium account in order to be able to download many images without rate limiting.
* upload to app store, ideally automatically, check auth at the beginning, cache local token with key (rights = 600)
  * maybe upload into a test repo just for now
* idea: add a tool as an after-update-sanity-check -> "visit all git diffs and ensure on docker image tags have been changed" otherwise through error.
* option to ignore updates on specific service, e.g. the database
* concurrency: RunDocker(..., port) function executes its logic concurrently. However, we add a lock, that ensures that maximum one instance per port is running at the same time. Should make updates much faster

* add apps?
  * take care of todo folder: either make it a production app or remove it
  * odoo for ERP
  * limesurvey for feedback
  * "discuit" for memes
  * lemmy as alternative to reddit
  * make a video where I set up and explain all apps that are currently official + specialities in guides
  * consider other apps from the internal list

* store gui repalcement:
  * maybe publish this at the end as CLI tool so others can use it
  * do I need and app store GUI at all, if I can simply interact with the server via CLI? Maybe even smarter, since it can automate stuff like updating, zipping, signing and uploading the app, etc.
